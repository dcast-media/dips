# DIP-0002: Ad Offer Metadata Schema

## Abstract

The **d>sponsor** framework employs smart contracts for the management of ad offers. However, these contracts do not inherently store metadata, such as information about the offeror or details regarding the sponsorshipâ€”including its description and rules. Addressing this gap, the proposal outlines a method for associating ad offers with their respective metadata.

## Metadata Storing Strategy

To effectively link ad offer metadata with **d>sponsor** smart contracts, the following strategy is proposed:

1. **Metadata Storage**: Metadata should be organized in a JSON format and stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ensuring decentralization and availability.
2. **Metadata Linkage**: When creating an ad offer through the **d>sponsor** offer creation smart contract, the IPFS link containing the metadata should be submitted as the `offerMetadata` argument.
3. **Metadata Accessibility**: A subgraph or any smart contract gateway is tasked with fetching and parsing the JSON metadata from the IPFS link, as denoted by the `offerMetadata` argument provided by the `UpdateOffer` event.

## Schema Definition

Below is the proposed schema for the ad offer metadata, detailing the keys and their descriptions. This schema is designed to encapsulate essential information about the ad offers, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of each offer's nuances and requirements.
